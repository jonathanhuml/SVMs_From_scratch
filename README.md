# SVMs_From_scratch
This is an implementation of various support vector machines from scratch. Because all SVMs are convex programming problems, we can use off-the-shelf quadratic solvers like CVXOPT or CVXPY. I was highly impressed with CVXPY. CVXOPT is convenient for some programs, but I think CVXPY is far easier to read and understand what we're trying to do.  In the folder, you'll find a paper describing the models used and the different aspects of each. We include all of the explicit nonlinear programming formulations. 
I found this to be a fairly interesting project. Letting a package do all the work for you is a nice way to get up and running fast (and also, once you learn the math, you get all of the nice features) but tends to obscure the details, or at least let you think you understand the problem without actually understanding. The last model--the quadratic surface SVM (QSSVM)--is particularly interesting. I had conceptualized the SVM as a mostly-linear tool, but the QSSVM dispels that notion.
